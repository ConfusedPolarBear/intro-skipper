Analyzes the audio of television episodes to detect and skip over intros.

If you use the custom web interface on your server, you will be able to click a button to skip intros, like this:

However, if you want to use an unmodified installation of Jellyfin 10.8.z or use clients that do not use the web interface provided by the server, the plugin can be configured to automatically skip intros.

## System requirements

* Jellyfin 10.8.4 (or newer)
* Jellyfin's [fork](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg) of `ffmpeg` must be installed, version `5.0.1-5` or newer
  * `jellyfin/jellyfin` 10.8.z container: preinstalled
  * `linuxserver/jellyfin` 10.8.z container: preinstalled
  * Debian Linux based native installs: provided by the `jellyfin-ffmpeg5` package

## Introduction requirements

Show introductions will only be detected if they are:

* Located within the first 25% of an episode, or the first 10 minutes, whichever is smaller
* Between 15 seconds and 2 minutes long

All of these requirements can be customized as needed.

## Installation instructions

### Step 1: Install the modified web interface (optional)
While this plugin is fully compatible with an unmodified version of Jellyfin 10.8.z, using a modified web interface allows you to click a button to skip intros. If you skip this step and do not use the modified web interface, you will have to enable the "Automatically skip intros" option in the plugin settings.

Instructions on how to switch web interface versions are located [here](docs/web_interface.md).

### Step 2: Install the plugin
1. Add this plugin repository to your server: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConfusedPolarBear/intro-skipper/master/manifest.json`
2. Install the Intro Skipper plugin from the General section
3. Restart Jellyfin
4. If you did not install the modified web interface, enable automatic skipping
    1. Go to Dashboard -> Plugins -> Intro Skipper
    2. Check "Automatically skip intros" and click Save
5. Go to Dashboard -> Scheduled Tasks -> Analyze Episodes and click the play button
6. After a season has completed analyzing, play some episodes from it and observe the results
    1. Status updates are logged before analyzing each season of a show
